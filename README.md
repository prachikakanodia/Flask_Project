# Integrate Technologies to create Web-Application.

I have taken the PIMA INDIANS DIABETES DATASET and after raw data analysis it will give the output in terms of Binary Classification i.e. 0/1 so that we can able to know whether a person is suffering from diabetes or not after considering certain factors.

# --> Keras and Flask
Flask is a backend framework used to create web-applications and Keras is the library in Deep Learning which provides many functions in single module to use in neural network algorithms to create ML model.

# --> Machine Learning
It is a type of artificial intelligence ( AI ) that allows software applications to become more accurate in predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed.

# --> Deep Learning
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning, which is essentially a neural network with three or more layers for deep study of data.

# --> Docker
Docker is a tool using which launching container can be managed which automatically provides resources to us and launch in just a second.

# --> Python
Programming language i.e. Python used to support backend flask framework to load ML/DL model.

# --> HTML and CSS
HTML and CSS used for UI/UX as frontend to create web-applications.
